<h1>Extension callbacks</h1>
<p>
    As we <a href="loading-extension">explained before</a>, the get_module()
    function is called when your extension is started. It returns a memory address 
    where the Zend engine can find all relevant information about your extension.
</p>
<p>
    After this get_module() call, your extension is loaded and will be used to handle
    <i>multiple</i> pageviews. This is an important difference between standard
    PHP scripts and native extensions, because standard PHP scripts handle only a single
    pageview. But extensions serve multiple pageviews after each other.
</p>
<p>
    This difference is especially important if you use global C++ variables. 
    Such global variables are initialized when the extension is loaded - and not at 
    the beginning of each pageview. Changes that you make to global variables keep 
    their value, and subsequent requests will therefore see the updated values. 
</p>
<p>
    This, by the way, only happens to <i>native</i> variables. Global PHP variables,
    stored in the Php::GLOBALS object, are re-initialized at the beginning of 
    each request. You do not have to worry about changes that you make to 
    global PHP variables: at the beginning of the next request, the Php::GLOBALS
    object is fresh and new, and the changes that you made during the
    previous request are no longer visible.
</p>
<p>
    Back to the global C++ variables. If you want to reset a global variable
    at the beginning of a new request, you can register a special callback function 
    that gets called in front of each request.
</p>
<p>
<pre class="language-c++"><code>#include &lt;phpcpp.h&gt;

/**
 *  Global variable that stores the number of times 
 *  the function updateCounters() has been called in total
 *  @var    int
 */
int invokeTotalCount = 0;

/**
 *  Global variable that keeps track how many times the
 *  function updateCounters() was called during the

int invokeDuringRequestCount = 0;

{
    // increment global counters
    invokeTotalCount++;
    invokeDuringRequestCount++;
}

 *  to have a C style function signature

     *  Startup function that is automatically called by the Zend engine
     *  when PHP starts, and that should return the extension details
     *  @return void*
     */
    PHPCPP_EXPORT void *get_module() 
    {
        // the extension object
        static Php::Extension extension("my_extension", "1.0");
        
        // install a callback that is called at the beginning 
        // of each request
        extension.onRequest([]() {
            
            // re-initialize the counter
            invokeDuringRequestCount = 0;
        });
        
        // add the updateCounter method to the extension
        extension.add("updateCounters", updateCounters);
        
        // return the extension details
        return extension;
    }
}</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
    The Php::Extension class has a method onRequest() that is used in the
    above example to register a callback function. This callback is called right 
    before every pageview/request. And as you can see, it is 
    permitted to use C++ lambda functions.
</p>
<p>
    The onRequest() is not the only method in the Php::Extension object to
    register a callback. There are in fact
    four different on*() methods that you can use.
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>void onStartup(const std::function&lt;void()&gt; &callback);</li>
        <li>void onRequest(const std::function&lt;void()&gt; &callback);</li>
        <li>void onIdle(const std::function&lt;void()&gt; &callback);</li>
        <li>void onShutdown(const std::function&lt;void()&gt; &callback);</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    The startup callback is called when the Zend engine has loaded your extension 
    and all functions and classes in it were registered. If you want to initialize 
    additional variables in your extension before the functions are going to get called, 
    you can use the onStartup() function and register a callback to run this
    initialization code.
</p>
<p>
    After the Zend engine is initialized, it is ready to process requests. In the
    example above we used the onRequest() method to register a callback that is
    called in front of each request. Next to that, you can also install a callback that gets called
    <i>after</i> each request, when the Zend engine moves to an idle state - waiting
    for the next request. This can be accomplished with the onIdle()
    method in the Php::Extension object.
</p>
<p>
    The fourth callback that you can register is a callback that gets called 
    right before PHP shuts down. If there is anything to clean up, you can install
    such a callback and run the cleanup code from it.
